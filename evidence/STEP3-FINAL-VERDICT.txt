EXECUTION TIMELINE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

22:14:33 UTC - First customer SMS (pipeline failed - no API key)
23:04:27 UTC - Second customer SMS received
23:04:29 UTC - Lead created in database
23:04:34 UTC - Lead marked as URGENT
23:04:36 UTC - Customer received confirmation SMS

Total Duration: <10 seconds (from SMS to qualification)
Well under 2-minute requirement ✓

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL FINDING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BLOCKER: Business alert notification not delivered

Root Cause:
- NotificationService requires ADMIN_PHONE or ADMIN_EMAIL in environment
- Neither variable is configured in .env
- Notification payload was correctly constructed
- Delivery mechanism exists but has no destination

Impact:
- Customer experience: COMPLETE ✓
- Lead qualification: COMPLETE ✓
- Business notification: INCOMPLETE ✗

Current State:
Business owner MUST manually check dashboard to discover qualified leads.
This violates the "no human intervention" requirement.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL VERDICT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FAIL

Reason:
Business did not receive qualified alert due to missing notification configuration.

While the AI receptionist successfully:
✓ Captured the inbound inquiry
✓ Classified urgency correctly (URGENT/flood risk)
✓ Extracted all job details (plumbing, tomorrow morning, leak)
✓ Responded to customer with booking link
✓ Marked lead as escalated in database

It failed to:
✗ Deliver actionable notification to business owner

Without delivery of the business alert, the system does not fulfill its
promise: "JobRun replaces missed calls with an AI receptionist that texts
both the customer AND the business automatically."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REQUIRED FIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

To pass Step 3, add to .env:

ADMIN_PHONE=+44XXXXXXXXXX
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@jobrun.uk

Then rerun the test.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
VALUE PROOF STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ NOT AUTHORIZED FOR SALES

JobRun demonstrates strong AI capabilities but requires notification
configuration to fulfill its core value proposition.

The system CANNOT currently deliver on the promise:
"Convert missed calls into qualified leads with alerts to both parties."
