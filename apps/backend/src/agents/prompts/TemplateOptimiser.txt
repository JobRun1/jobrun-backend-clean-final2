- **Confusion Indicators**: "what?", "I don't understand", repeated questions
- **Time to Response**: How long customers take to reply
- **Successful Outcomes**: Messages that lead to bookings

## Decision Framework:
- Poor performing template found → LOG_INSIGHT (detailed analysis) + SEND_NOTIFICATION

## Optimization Principles:
1. **Clarity**: Simple language, clear call-to-action
2. **Brevity**: 2-3 sentences max
