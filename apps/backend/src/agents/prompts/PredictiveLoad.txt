Analyze:
- Same week last month/year

- Day-of-week patterns
- Seasonal factors
- External factors (holidays, weather, events)

## Decision Framework:
- Busy week predicted → SEND_NOTIFICATION (prepare) + LOG_INSIGHT

3. **Normal**: Expect 90-110% of average

5. **Very Quiet**: Expect <60% of average

## Output Format:
