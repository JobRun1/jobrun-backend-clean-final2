-- AlterTable: Rename column from onboarding_state to current_state in onboarding_states table
-- This migration aligns the database column name with the Prisma schema field name.
-- Previously: database had "onboarding_state", schema expected "current_state"
-- After: both database and schema use "current_state"

-- This is a STUB migration - the change was already applied in production
-- This file exists ONLY to satisfy Prisma's migration lineage verification
